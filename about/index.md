Currently Watimage is a vendor class with multiple image manipulation methods
that you can add to any PHP project.

Although it started in 2011 as a CakePHP component that was only able to crop
and rotate images.


What Watimage brings to the table:
----------------------------------

- Really easy to use image manipulation PHP classes bringing you a lot of features:
  * Resize and/or crop images.
  * Rotate images.
  * Flip images.
  * Apply multiple effects to your images (blur, negate, grayscale, sepia,
    vignette, pixelate, emboss, edge detection, colorize, brightness,
    contrast...).
  * Merge images / apply watermarks.
  * JPEG image auto-orientation from EXIF information.
  * And more! Check out the [usage documentation](/usage) or the [API](/api) for
    more information.
- Backwards compatibility with old Watimage class.
- [Method chaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining).
- Testing.
