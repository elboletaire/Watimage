Watimage is a PHP class to resize, rotate and apply watermark to images.

It was initially thought as a CakePHP Component, but now is a standalone class,
so you can use it everywhere :D

Installing
----------

With composer:

```bash
composer require elboletaire/watimage 1.0.0
```

As a git submodule:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/elboletaire/Watimage.git Vendor/Elboletaire/Watimage
```

Usage
-----

### As standalone class

```php
// In top of your document (if you use composer's autoloader)
use Elboletaire\Watimage\Watimage;
// If you're not using composer's autoloader, then require it manually
// require_once 'Vendor/Elboletaire/Watimage/src/Watimage.php';

$wm = new Watimage();
$wm->setImage('original_file.png');
$wm->setWatermark('watermark.png');

// Resize image to 400x400px
$wm->resize(array('type' => 'resizecrop', 'size' => 400));

// Flip it horitzontally
$wm->flip('horizontal');

// Rotate 90 degrees
$wm->rotate(90);

// Apply the watermark
$wm->applyWatermark();

// Generate and save image
if ( !$wm->generate('result.png') ) {
    // handle errors...
    print_r($wm->errors);
}
```

![result_example](http://www.racotecnic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/test6.png "result_example")

You have an example.php file with more examples.

Testing
-------

Currently there are only methods to visually check that all images are properly
generated.

To run them just cd into the visual tests folders and run the `run_them_all.php` script:

```bash
cd tests/visual
php run_them_all.php
```

It will generate a bunch of files in `tests/visual/results` where you can check
if everything is running as expected.
